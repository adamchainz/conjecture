Conjecture for Java feasibility prototype
=========================================

This is a very rough prototype of what Conjecture could look like in Java. It's not even
close to being production ready software. It implements the core algorithm and a very crude
API. It has only been lightly tested. It exists to prove that the concept is feasible, and it
achieves it.

If you are interested in a fully fledge Conjecture for Java, please
`contact me<mailto:david@drmaciver.com>`_ to discuss rates for developing it.
