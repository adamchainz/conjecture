=============================
Conjecture research prototype
=============================

This is the Python research prototype of conjecture. It implements the
fundamental algorithm of Conjecture but is *not* itself intended as usable
production ready software. In particular it lacks some of the practical but
not very interesting features (example saving) and the provided strategies are
somewhat low quality and half-baked.

If you want this sort of testing in Python, may I recommend `Hypothesis <http://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/>`_?
