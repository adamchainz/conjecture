Python bindings for Conjecture
==============================

These are some extremely rudimentary bindings for using Conjecture from Python.

They are currently entirely undocumented and almost unusably bad. Sorry! They
mostly exist to help me flesh out what's needed to make them possible. They should
grow in maturity as Conjecture proper does.
